Juniper is unable to provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the overall high variability and low visibility of most of the foregoing items that have been excluded. For example, share-based compensation expense is impacted by the Company\u2019s future hiring needs, the type and volume of equity awards necessary for such future hiring, and the price at which the Company\u2019s stock will trade in those future periods. Amortization of intangible assets is significantly impacted by the timing and size of any future acquisitions. The items that are being excluded are difficult to predict and a reconciliation could result in disclosure that would be imprecise or potentially misleading. Material changes to any one of these items could have a significant effect on our guidance and future GAAP results.

Actual results or events could differ materially from those anticipated in those forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including: the duration, extent and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; general economic and political conditions globally or regionally; business and economic conditions in the networking industry; changes in overall technology spending by our customers, including Cloud providers and Service Providers; the network capacity requirements of our customers and, in particular, Cloud and telecommunication service providers; contractual terms that may result in the deferral of revenue; the timing of orders and their fulfillment; manufacturing and supply chain costs, constraints, changes or disruptions; availability and pricing of key product components; delays in scheduled product availability; adoption of regulations or standards affecting Juniper Networks products, services or the networking industry; product defects, returns or vulnerabilities; significant effects of tax legislation and judicial or administrative interpretation of tax regulations and judicial or administrative interpretation of tax regulations; legal settlements and resolutions; the potential impact of activities related to the execution of capital return, restructurings and product rationalization; the impact of import tariffs, depending on their scope and how they are implemented; and other factors listed in Juniper Networks\u2019 most recent report on Form 10-Q or 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

These measures are not presented in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for GAAP. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the table above should not be considered in isolation from measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In particular, certain of the adjustments to our GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future.", "We utilize a number of different financial measures, both GAAP and non-GAAP, in analyzing and assessing the overall performance of our business, in making operating decisions, forecasting and planning for future periods, and determining payments under compensation programs. We consider the use of the non-GAAP measures presented above to be helpful in assessing the performance of the continuing operation of our business. By continuing operation, we mean the ongoing revenue and expenses of the business, excluding certain items that render comparisons with prior periods or analysis of on-going operating trends more difficult, such as expenses not directly related to the actual cash costs of development, sale, delivery or support of our products and services, or expenses that are reflected in periods unrelated to when the actual amounts were incurred or paid. Consistent with this approach, we believe that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the readers of our financial statements provides such readers with useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, allows for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance. In addition, we have historically reported non-GAAP results to the investment community and believe that continuing to provide non-GAAP measures provides investors with a tool for comparing results over time. In assessing the overall health of our business for the periods covered by the table above and, in particular, in evaluating the financial line items presented in the table above, we have excluded items in the following three general categories, each of which are described below: Acquisition and Strategic Investment Related Charges, Other Items, and Share-Based Compensation Related Items. We also provide additional detail below regarding the shares used to calculate our non-GAAP net income per share. Notes identified for line items in the table above correspond to the appropriate note description below. With respect to the items excluded from our forward-looking non-GAAP measures and reconciliation of such measures, please see the \u201cOutlook\u201d section above.", "Note A: Acquisition and Strategic Investment Related Charges", ". We exclude certain expense items resulting from acquisitions including\u00a0amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. The amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisitions results in our recording expenses in our GAAP financial statements that were already expensed by the acquired company before the acquisition and for which we have not expended cash. Moreover, had we internally developed the products acquired, the amortization of intangible assets, and the expenses of uncompleted research and development would have been expensed in prior periods. Accordingly, we analyze the performance of our operations in each period without regard to such expenses. In addition, acquisitions result in non-continuing operating expenses, which would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our business operations. We believe that providing non-GAAP information for acquisition-related expense items in addition to the corresponding GAAP information allows the users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historic and current results of our continuing operations, and also facilitates comparisons to less acquisitive peer companies.", "Note B: Other Items", ". We exclude certain other items that are the result of either unique, infrequent or unplanned events, including the following, when applicable: (i)\u00a0restructuring charges or benefits; (ii) strategic partnership-related charges (iii) legal reserve and settlement charges or benefits; (iv) gain or loss on equity investments; (v)\u00a0significant effects of tax legislation and judicial or administrative interpretation of tax regulations, including the impact of income tax reform; (vi) recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits that are non-recurring in nature; (vii) the income tax effect on our financial statements of excluding items related to our non-GAAP financial measures. It is difficult to estimate the amount or timing of these items in advance. Although these events are reflected in our GAAP financial statements, these transactions may limit the comparability of our on-going operations with prior and future periods. Restructuring benefits or charges result from events that arise from unforeseen circumstances, which often occur outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations. These expenses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred. We also exclude certain expenses incurred for the formation of a strategic partnership, as they are directly related to an event that is distinct and does not reflect current ongoing business operations. In the case of legal reserves and settlements, these gains or losses are recorded in the period in which the matter is concluded or resolved even though the subject matter of the underlying dispute may relate to multiple or different periods. As such, we believe that these expenses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing operations for the period in which they are incurred. Additionally, we exclude previously unrecognized tax benefits that are non-recurring in nature which are recorded in the period in which applicable statutes of limitation lapse or upon the completion of tax review cycles as the tax matter may relate to multiple or different periods. Further, the impact of certain income tax reform, including the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are unique events that occur in periods that are generally unrelated to the level of business activity to which such tax reform or legislation applies. We believe these tax events limit the comparability with prior periods and that these expenses or benefits do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred.\u00a0We also believe providing financial information with and without the income tax effect of excluding items related to our non-GAAP financial measures provide our management and users of the financial statements with better clarity regarding the on-going performance and future liquidity of our business. Because of these factors, we assess our operating performance with these amounts both included and excluded, and by providing this information, we believe the users of our financial statements are better able to understand the financial results of what we consider our continuing operations.", "Note C: Share-Based Compensation Related Items", ". We provide non-GAAP information relative to our expense for share-based compensation and related payroll tax. Due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types, which affect the calculations of share-based compensation, we believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation and related payroll tax allows for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to our peer companies and is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to our results of operations. Further, expense associated with granting share-based awards does not reflect any cash expenditures by the company as no cash is expended.", "Note D: Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share Items", ". We provide diluted non-GAAP net income per share. The diluted non-GAAP net income per share includes additional dilution from potential issuance of common stock, except when such issuances would be anti-dilutive.", "Investor Relations:\u00a0", "Jess Lubert ", "Juniper Networks ", "(408) 936-3734\u00a0", "jlubert@juniper.net", "Media Relations:", "Leslie Moore", "Juniper Networks", "(408) 936-5767", "llmoore@juniper.net"], "tickers": ["JNPR"]},

Our first priority is the safety and well-being of our employees and we implemented a number of safety protocols during the quarter, that are still in place, in an effort to keep our employees and their families safe and healthy,\u201d said Eileen Drake, CEO and President of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. \u201cThroughout all of this, I am very proud of the Aerojet Rocketdyne team and their ability to stay focused and productive.\u201d", "\u201cTotal backlog at March 31, 2020 was $5.2 billion, up 37% from $3.8 billion a year ago primarily driven by multi-year awards on THAAD and various Raytheon programs, mainly Standard Missile,\u201d said Drake. \u201cWe anticipate $2.0 billion of that to convert to sales over the next 12 months. We ended the quarter with strong EBITDAP margins of 13.1%, on sales of $476.1 million. Sales were down 3% year over year driven by lower sales from the Commercial Crew Development program, the shipment of the final AJ-60 solid rocket motor that occurred in the first quarter of 2019 and headwinds from the canceled RKV program. While the full impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Aerojet Rocketdyne are not yet known, I am very pleased with how our employees have been flexible, maintained discipline and continue to deliver the products necessary to defend our nation and further space exploration.\u201d", "First quarter of 2020 compared with first quarter of 2019", "The decrease in net sales was primarily due to a decline of $21.3 million in space program sales primarily driven by (i) lower sales in the Commercial Crew Development program and (ii) the final shipment of the AJ-60 solid rocket motor that occurred in the first quarter of 2019, partially offset by growth in the RS-25 program. The decline in net sales was partially offset by an increase of $5.7 million in defense program sales primarily driven by the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (\u201cGMLRS\u201d) and hypersonic booster programs, partially offset by declines in the Redesigned Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (\u201cRKV\u201d) program which was canceled in 2019.", "The decrease in net income was impacted by (i) 2020 cost growth on a portion of the Standard Missile program and the reserve release upon the final AJ-60 solid rocket motor delivery in 2019 and (ii) higher retirement benefits expense, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation. The Company had $1.9 million of favorable changes in contract estimates on net income in the current period compared with favorable changes of $9.7 million in the first quarter of 2019.", "Backlog", "As of March 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s total remaining performance obligations, also referred to as backlog, totaled $5.2 billion.

Indefinite delivery and quantity contracts and unexercised options are not reported in total backlog. Backlog is subject to funding delays or program restructurings/cancellations which are beyond the Company\u2019s control.", "COVID-19", "During the three months ended March 31, 2020, there was minimal impact to the Company\u2019s financial results and operations as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak that began in late 2019, and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The safety and welfare of employees is a top priority, and in the quarter, a number of safety protocols were established. Selected and site-specific work and travel restrictions, in addition to other measures intended to reduce the spread of COVID-19, were introduced. Although the Company did not experience significant absenteeism or supply chain disruption, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the Company\u2019s financial results and operations for 2020 and beyond will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the pandemic and the actions being taken to contain and treat it, and other indirect effects that may come as a result of actions taken by governments, companies, and individuals in response to the pandemic and its economic impact.", "Forward-Looking Statements", "This release contains certain \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Segment performance represents net sales less applicable costs, expenses and provisions for unusual items relating to the segment. Excluded from segment performance are: corporate income and expenses, interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and unusual items not related to the segment. The Company believes that segment performance provides information useful to investors in understanding its underlying operational performance.", "Use of Unaudited Non-GAAP Financial Measures", "Adjusted EBITDAP, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS", "The Company provides the Non-GAAP financial measures of its performance called Adjusted EBITDAP, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS. The Company uses these metrics to measure its operating and total Company performance. The Company believes that for management and investors to effectively compare core performance from period to period, the metrics should exclude items that are not indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from the ongoing business operations such as retirement benefits (pension and postretirement benefits), significant non-cash expenses, the impacts of financing decisions on earnings, and items incurred outside the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of business. Accordingly, the Company defines Adjusted EBITDAP as GAAP net income adjusted to exclude interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, retirement benefits net of amounts that are recoverable under the Company\u2019s U.S. government contracts, and unusual items which the Company does not believe are reflective of such ordinary, ongoing and customary activities. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS exclude retirement benefits net of amounts that are recoverable under its U.S. government contracts and unusual items which the Company does not believe are reflective of such ordinary, ongoing and customary activities. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS do not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income or diluted EPS as determined in accordance with GAAP.", "_________", "(1) \u00a0 The income tax impact is calculated using the federal and state statutory rates in the corresponding period.", "Free Cash Flow", "The Company also provides the Non-GAAP financial measure of Free Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to cash flows from operations presented in accordance with GAAP.
