Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) today joined leaders from the BlueGreen Alliance and former Assistant Secretary of Labor for the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) David Michaels to honor workers who have died on the job this year\u2014including those who lost their battle with Covid-19\u2014and to call on OSHA to protect workers during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0", "LISTEN TO THE AUDIO FROM THE EVENT.", "\u00a0", "\u201cWe are calling on OSHA and the Trump administration to address the most urgent threat facing working people today: the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d said, Rep. DeLauro, chair of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, which oversees funding for the Department of Labor, OSHA, and the Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cTo date, OSHA has not released enforceable emergency standards to protect workers from the virus; instead, it has offered only non-binding guidance. As states begin to seek to re-open the economy, OSHA must uphold its mission, making sure employers are taking the necessary steps to keep their employees safe from this pandemic.\u201d\u00a0", "To date, OSHA has not released enforceable emergency standards\u2014instead offering only guidance, nor has it developed any strategy for safety training or workplace inspections at a scale the crisis requires.", "\u00a0", "\u00a0\u201cIn OSHA\u2019s own words, a guidance is \u2018advisory in nature\u2019 and \u2018not a standard or a regulation\u2019 and that means that an employer who wants to ignore it can ignore it without consequence,\u201d said BlueGreen Alliance Executive Director Jason Walsh. \u201cOSHA is putting out guidance that is non-enforceable by design", ",\u00a0", "while workers are putting their lives on the line.\u201d", "A recent media investigation uncovered more than 3,000 Covid-19 related employee complaints filed with OSHA since the beginning of the year. The complaints come from a wide variety of sectors and raise critical issues such as lack of access to personal protective equipment (PPE) and even hand sanitizer or soap, employees being forced to work in close contact with other workers\u2014including those who appear sick\u2014 and other concerns.\u00a0\u00a0", "\u201cWe are grateful for those American workers risking their lives\u00a0fighting to keep our nation healthy, fed, and to ensure we all have access to the vital resources we need. We owe it to them to fight for their safety,\u201d said Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune. \u201cThis pandemic has shown the glaring holes in the laws and regulations that exist to protect workers in this country, and frankly, this administration has done nothing to actually protect workers.\u201d\u00a0", "\u201cHealth care, food service, and so many other essential workers who are caring for Americans during this Covid pandemic are working without protection and getting sick. Over 52,000 Americans have already died from Covid-19, many are our colleagues, our relatives, our friends and our neighbors,\u201d said American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten. \u201cWe must force OSHA to do its job and adopt an enforceable emergency standard.\u201d\u00a0", "The leaders called on Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia to immediately enact and enforce an emergency standard to protect frontline workers, who are disproportionately people of color, and to use existing authority to existing agency standards for personal protective equipment, sanitation, and hazardous substances, as well as their legally required obligation to provide a safe workplace. In addition, they said they support two measures in Congress introduced by Congressman Bobby Scott (D-VA)\u2014H.R. 6139, the Covid-19 Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2020 and H.R. 6559, the Covid-19 Every Worker Protection Act of 2020\u2014that would force the agency to address concerns around Covid-19.\u00a0\u00a0", "\u201cOur union is pushing for a massive increase in appropriate PPE for all workers, more rapid and reliable coronavirus testing, and a system for reporting and tracking workplace infections, so that all workers can stay safe on the job,\u201d said USW International Secretary-Treasurer John Shinn. \u201cMost importantly, decisions concerning workplace safety during this pandemic must be based on sound science and worker involvement.\u201d", "\u00a0", "\u201cThis crisis has underscored the value of a safe and healthy workforce.\u201d said Michaels, who was the longest-serving administrator in OSHA history. \u201cWe see the vital importance of the previously invisible low wage workers who grow our crops, process our meat, and ensure food gets to our table. In this crisis, we now recognize our these are essential, indispensable workers\u2014we have to ensure they are safe, not just for their sake, but for ours.\u201d", "-30-", "The BlueGreen Alliance unites America\u2019s largest labor unions and its most influential environmental organizations to solve today\u2019s environmental challenges in ways that create and maintain quality jobs and build a stronger, fairer economy.

We ended the quarter with strong EBITDAP margins of 13.1%, on sales of $476.1 million. Sales were down 3% year over year driven by lower sales from the Commercial Crew Development program, the shipment of the final AJ-60 solid rocket motor that occurred in the first quarter of 2019 and headwinds from the canceled RKV program.

The decline in net sales was partially offset by an increase of $5.7 million in defense program sales primarily driven by the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (\u201cGMLRS\u201d) and hypersonic booster programs, partially offset by declines in the Redesigned Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (\u201cRKV\u201d) program which was canceled in 2019.", "The decrease in net income was impacted by (i) 2020 cost growth on a portion of the Standard Missile program and the reserve release upon the final AJ-60 solid rocket motor delivery in 2019 and (ii) higher retirement benefits expense, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation.

Juniper is unable to provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the overall high variability and low visibility of most of the foregoing items that have been excluded. For example, share-based compensation expense is impacted by the Company\u2019s future hiring needs, the type and volume of equity awards necessary for such future hiring, and the price at which the Company\u2019s stock will trade in those future periods. Amortization of intangible assets is significantly impacted by the timing and size of any future acquisitions. The items that are being excluded are difficult to predict and a reconciliation could result in disclosure that would be imprecise or potentially misleading.

In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the table above should not be considered in isolation from measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In particular, certain of the adjustments to our GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future.", "We utilize a number of different financial measures, both GAAP and non-GAAP, in analyzing and assessing the overall performance of our business, in making operating decisions, forecasting and planning for future periods, and determining payments under compensation programs. We consider the use of the non-GAAP measures presented above to be helpful in assessing the performance of the continuing operation of our business. By continuing operation, we mean the ongoing revenue and expenses of the business, excluding certain items that render comparisons with prior periods or analysis of on-going operating trends more difficult, such as expenses not directly related to the actual cash costs of development, sale, delivery or support of our products and services, or expenses that are reflected in periods unrelated to when the actual amounts were incurred or paid. Consistent with this approach, we believe that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the readers of our financial statements provides such readers with useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, allows for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance. In addition, we have historically reported non-GAAP results to the investment community and believe that continuing to provide non-GAAP measures provides investors with a tool for comparing results over time. In assessing the overall health of our business for the periods covered by the table above and, in particular, in evaluating the financial line items presented in the table above, we have excluded items in the following three general categories, each of which are described below: Acquisition and Strategic Investment Related Charges, Other Items, and Share-Based Compensation Related Items. We also provide additional detail below regarding the shares used to calculate our non-GAAP net income per share. Notes identified for line items in the table above correspond to the appropriate note description below.

We exclude certain expense items resulting from acquisitions including\u00a0amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. The amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisitions results in our recording expenses in our GAAP financial statements that were already expensed by the acquired company before the acquisition and for which we have not expended cash. Moreover, had we internally developed the products acquired, the amortization of intangible assets, and the expenses of uncompleted research and development would have been expensed in prior periods. Accordingly, we analyze the performance of our operations in each period without regard to such expenses. In addition, acquisitions result in non-continuing operating expenses, which would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our business operations. We believe that providing non-GAAP information for acquisition-related expense items in addition to the corresponding GAAP information allows the users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historic and current results of our continuing operations, and also facilitates comparisons to less acquisitive peer companies.", "Note B: Other Items", ". We exclude certain other items that are the result of either unique, infrequent or unplanned events, including the following, when applicable: (i)\u00a0restructuring charges or benefits; (ii) strategic partnership-related charges (iii) legal reserve and settlement charges or benefits; (iv) gain or loss on equity investments; (v)\u00a0significant effects of tax legislation and judicial or administrative interpretation of tax regulations, including the impact of income tax reform; (vi) recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits that are non-recurring in nature; (vii) the income tax effect on our financial statements of excluding items related to our non-GAAP financial measures. It is difficult to estimate the amount or timing of these items in advance. Although these events are reflected in our GAAP financial statements, these transactions may limit the comparability of our on-going operations with prior and future periods. Restructuring benefits or charges result from events that arise from unforeseen circumstances, which often occur outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations. These expenses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred. We also exclude certain expenses incurred for the formation of a strategic partnership, as they are directly related to an event that is distinct and does not reflect current ongoing business operations. In the case of legal reserves and settlements, these gains or losses are recorded in the period in which the matter is concluded or resolved even though the subject matter of the underlying dispute may relate to multiple or different periods. As such, we believe that these expenses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing operations for the period in which they are incurred. Additionally, we exclude previously unrecognized tax benefits that are non-recurring in nature which are recorded in the period in which applicable statutes of limitation lapse or upon the completion of tax review cycles as the tax matter may relate to multiple or different periods. Further, the impact of certain income tax reform, including the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are unique events that occur in periods that are generally unrelated to the level of business activity to which such tax reform or legislation applies. We believe these tax events limit the comparability with prior periods and that these expenses or benefits do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred.\u00a0We also believe providing financial information with and without the income tax effect of excluding items related to our non-GAAP financial measures provide our management and users of the financial statements with better clarity regarding the on-going performance and future liquidity of our business. Because of these factors, we assess our operating performance with these amounts both included and excluded, and by providing this information, we believe the users of our financial statements are better able to understand the financial results of what we consider our continuing operations.", "Note C: Share-Based Compensation Related Items", ". We provide non-GAAP information relative to our expense for share-based compensation and related payroll tax. Due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types, which affect the calculations of share-based compensation, we believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation and related payroll tax allows for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to our peer companies and is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to our results of operations. Further, expense associated with granting share-based awards does not reflect any cash expenditures by the company as no cash is expended.", "Note D: Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share Items", ".

Juniper is unable to provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the overall high variability and low visibility of most of the foregoing items that have been excluded. For example, share-based compensation expense is impacted by the Company\u2019s future hiring needs, the type and volume of equity awards necessary for such future hiring, and the price at which the Company\u2019s stock will trade in those future periods. Amortization of intangible assets is significantly impacted by the timing and size of any future acquisitions. The items that are being excluded are difficult to predict and a reconciliation could result in disclosure that would be imprecise or potentially misleading. Material changes to any one of these items could have a significant effect on our guidance and future GAAP results.

These measures are not presented in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for GAAP. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the table above should not be considered in isolation from measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In particular, certain of the adjustments to our GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future.", "We utilize a number of different financial measures, both GAAP and non-GAAP, in analyzing and assessing the overall performance of our business, in making operating decisions, forecasting and planning for future periods, and determining payments under compensation programs. We consider the use of the non-GAAP measures presented above to be helpful in assessing the performance of the continuing operation of our business. By continuing operation, we mean the ongoing revenue and expenses of the business, excluding certain items that render comparisons with prior periods or analysis of on-going operating trends more difficult, such as expenses not directly related to the actual cash costs of development, sale, delivery or support of our products and services, or expenses that are reflected in periods unrelated to when the actual amounts were incurred or paid. Consistent with this approach, we believe that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the readers of our financial statements provides such readers with useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, allows for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance. In addition, we have historically reported non-GAAP results to the investment community and believe that continuing to provide non-GAAP measures provides investors with a tool for comparing results over time. In assessing the overall health of our business for the periods covered by the table above and, in particular, in evaluating the financial line items presented in the table above, we have excluded items in the following three general categories, each of which are described below: Acquisition and Strategic Investment Related Charges, Other Items, and Share-Based Compensation Related Items. We also provide additional detail below regarding the shares used to calculate our non-GAAP net income per share. Notes identified for line items in the table above correspond to the appropriate note description below. With respect to the items excluded from our forward-looking non-GAAP measures and reconciliation of such measures, please see the \u201cOutlook\u201d section above.", "Note A: Acquisition and Strategic Investment Related Charges", ". We exclude certain expense items resulting from acquisitions including\u00a0amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. The amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisitions results in our recording expenses in our GAAP financial statements that were already expensed by the acquired company before the acquisition and for which we have not expended cash. Moreover, had we internally developed the products acquired, the amortization of intangible assets, and the expenses of uncompleted research and development would have been expensed in prior periods. Accordingly, we analyze the performance of our operations in each period without regard to such expenses. In addition, acquisitions result in non-continuing operating expenses, which would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our business operations. We believe that providing non-GAAP information for acquisition-related expense items in addition to the corresponding GAAP information allows the users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historic and current results of our continuing operations, and also facilitates comparisons to less acquisitive peer companies.", "Note B: Other Items", ". We exclude certain other items that are the result of either unique, infrequent or unplanned events, including the following, when applicable: (i)\u00a0restructuring charges or benefits; (ii) strategic partnership-related charges (iii) legal reserve and settlement charges or benefits; (iv) gain or loss on equity investments; (v)\u00a0significant effects of tax legislation and judicial or administrative interpretation of tax regulations, including the impact of income tax reform; (vi) recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits that are non-recurring in nature; (vii) the income tax effect on our financial statements of excluding items related to our non-GAAP financial measures. It is difficult to estimate the amount or timing of these items in advance. Although these events are reflected in our GAAP financial statements, these transactions may limit the comparability of our on-going operations with prior and future periods. Restructuring benefits or charges result from events that arise from unforeseen circumstances, which often occur outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations. These expenses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred. We also exclude certain expenses incurred for the formation of a strategic partnership, as they are directly related to an event that is distinct and does not reflect current ongoing business operations. In the case of legal reserves and settlements, these gains or losses are recorded in the period in which the matter is concluded or resolved even though the subject matter of the underlying dispute may relate to multiple or different periods. As such, we believe that these expenses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing operations for the period in which they are incurred. Additionally, we exclude previously unrecognized tax benefits that are non-recurring in nature which are recorded in the period in which applicable statutes of limitation lapse or upon the completion of tax review cycles as the tax matter may relate to multiple or different periods. Further, the impact of certain income tax reform, including the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are unique events that occur in periods that are generally unrelated to the level of business activity to which such tax reform or legislation applies. We believe these tax events limit the comparability with prior periods and that these expenses or benefits do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred.\u00a0We also believe providing financial information with and without the income tax effect of excluding items related to our non-GAAP financial measures provide our management and users of the financial statements with better clarity regarding the on-going performance and future liquidity of our business. Because of these factors, we assess our operating performance with these amounts both included and excluded, and by providing this information, we believe the users of our financial statements are better able to understand the financial results of what we consider our continuing operations.", "Note C: Share-Based Compensation Related Items", ". We provide non-GAAP information relative to our expense for share-based compensation and related payroll tax. Due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types, which affect the calculations of share-based compensation, we believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation and related payroll tax allows for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to our peer companies and is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to our results of operations. Further, expense associated with granting share-based awards does not reflect any cash expenditures by the company as no cash is expended.", "Note D: Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share Items", ". We provide diluted non-GAAP net income per share. The diluted non-GAAP net income per share includes additional dilution from potential issuance of common stock, except when such issuances would be anti-dilutive.", "Investor Relations:\u00a0", "Jess Lubert ", "Juniper Networks ", "(408) 936-3734\u00a0", "jlubert@juniper.net", "Media Relations:", "Leslie Moore", "Juniper Networks", "(408) 936-5767", "llmoore@juniper.net"], "tickers": ["JNPR"]},

Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring the company's operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year-over-year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. The company also believes that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare the company's operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the company's properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of the company's properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact the company's results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of the company's performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as the company does, and, accordingly, the company's FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of the company's performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of the company's liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company's cash needs, including the company's ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. FFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.", "Cash Net Operating Income", "The company uses cash net operating income (\"NOI\") internally to evaluate and compare the operating performance of the company's properties.\u00a0The company believes cash NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the company's financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level, and when compared across periods, can be used to determine trends in earnings of the company's properties as this measure is not affected by (1) the non-cash revenue and expense recognition items, (2)\u00a0the cost of funds of the property owner, (3)\u00a0the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP or (4)\u00a0general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to the property owner. The company believes the exclusion of these items from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating the company's properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\u00a0Cash NOI is a measure of the operating performance of the company's properties but does not measure the company's performance as a whole. Cash NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income as computed in accordance with GAAP.", "Cash NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. The company defines cash NOI as operating revenues (rental income, tenant reimbursements, lease termination fees, ground lease rental income and other property income) less property and related expenses (property expenses, ground lease expense, property marketing costs, real estate taxes and insurance), adjusted for non-cash revenue and operating expense items such as straight-line rent, amortization of lease intangibles, amortization of lease incentives and other adjustments. Cash NOI also excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other nonproperty income and losses, acquisition-related expense, gains and losses from property dispositions, extraordinary items, tenant improvements, and leasing commissions.

Loan and lease growth was adversely impacted by reduced economic activity across all markets as a result of the voluntary or mandatory closures of public venues, businesses, schools and government offices due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the Company received a number of sizable loan paydowns in the beginning of the quarter, further impacting quarter-end loan balances. Core deposits (excluding brokered deposits) increased $132.6 million, or 3.5% on a linked quarter basis. At quarter-end, the percentage of wholesale funds to total assets was 10.1%, which was up from 8.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019 as the Company accessed some short-term wholesale funding out of an abundance of caution.

Our front-line professional drivers and mechanics take tremendous pride in being an essential service provider and safely delivering America\u2019s freight on-time and damage-free, while protecting their safety and health. In these challenging times, our non-driver associates continue to step up in numerous ways to remain productive and efficient, while ensuring the needs of our customers and drivers are being met. We remain focused, flexible and strategic as we constantly adjust and adapt to the changes affecting our business and associates. As we adapt to changing COVID-19 developments, we are deploying and executing our plans by being rational, logical and above all compassionate.", "\u201cOur results in first quarter 2020 reflect freight demand that was slightly below the same period a year ago.\u00a0 Following the pandemic declaration on March 11, we experienced above normal demand for two to three weeks as consumers purchased essential products for their homes. This led to demand for the full month of March 2020 being comparable to March a year ago.", "\u201cApril 2020 freight demand has held up fairly well so far, with some expected gradual weakening given that many parts of the U.S. economy are shut down or have been significantly curtailed. Our freight base is designed to more effectively manage through what we anticipate will be an extremely difficult economic environment in second quarter 2020, as a significant portion of our revenues come from delivering essential goods and products. 62% of revenues from our top 100 customers (85% of revenues in first quarter 2020) came from the discount retail, home improvement retail, food and beverage or consumer packaged goods verticals.\u201d", "Total revenues for the quarter decreased 1% to $592.7 million versus the prior year quarter, primarily attributable to lower Logistics and fuel surcharge revenues, partially offset by an increase in dedicated fleet revenues.", "Operating income of $31.1 million decreased $17.0 million, or 35%. Operating margin of 5.2% decreased 290 basis points due to a more challenging freight and rate market in One-Way Truckload and Logistics. In addition, as previously disclosed, we had a serious truck accident claim in first quarter 2020. As a result, we accrued insurance and claims expense of $10.0 million for this accident, that is included in our GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Our GAAP results also included $5.0 million of additional depreciation expense related to a change in estimated life of certain trucks expected to be sold in 2020. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted operating income of $37.3 million decreased $11.9 million, or 24%. Adjusted operating margin of 6.3% declined 190 basis points from 8.2% for the same quarter last year.", "Interest expense of $1.6 million was $0.7 million higher, or a $0.01 increase per share, due to higher average borrowings. The effective income tax rate during the quarter was 23.3% compared to 25.1% in first quarter 2019, or a $0.01 per share favorable impact. The current quarter tax rate was lower than our expected range of 25% to 26% because of a favorable discrete income tax item.", "Net income of $23.1 million decreased 36%. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income declined 25% to $27.7 million compared to $36.9 million for the same quarter last year.

The average revenues per truck increase was due primarily to an improvement in average miles per truck and to a lesser extent an increase in average revenues per total mile. The increase in average revenues per total mile was due primarily to relative strength in Dedicated pricing, mostly offset by a 3.7% decrease in One-Way Truckload pricing.", "As we referenced in our COVID-19 Business Update on March 26, 2020, our results in first quarter 2020 in our One-Way Truckload fleet included freight demand in January and February that was seasonally normal and slightly lower than the same period a year ago. March 2020 freight demand was comparable to March 2019, and demand strengthened during the last two to three weeks of March 2020.", "In our Dedicated fleet, freight demand remained steady in first quarter 2020 with above normal demand in March for store replenishment, primarily due to customer inventory restocking following consumers buying essential products for their households after the pandemic declaration.", "During first quarter 2020, we changed the estimated life of certain trucks currently expected to be sold in 2020 to more rapidly depreciate these trucks to their estimated residual values due to the weak used truck market. The effect of this change in accounting estimate increased first quarter 2020 depreciation expense by $5.0 million, or five cents per share. These trucks will continue to depreciate at the same higher rate per truck until the trucks are sold.\u00a0 This expense is included in GAAP earnings per share and is adjusted as a non-GAAP item due to the unusual and infrequent nature of this expense.", "In first quarter 2020, company truck miles increased by approximately 6.4 million miles, and independent contractor miles decreased by approximately 1.9 million miles.", "Comparisons of key financial metrics for the TTS segment, including operating ratios (actual and net of fuel surcharge revenues), are shown below. Fluctuating fuel prices and fuel surcharge revenues impact the total company operating ratio and the TTS segment\u2019s operating ratio when fuel surcharges are reported on a gross basis as revenues versus netting against fuel expenses.

Intermodal revenues declined 6%.", "The gross margin percentage decreased 280 bps to 14.5% due primarily to a softer freight market, and contractual brokerage had a higher cost of capacity in March 2020 due to higher replenishment activity. The logistics operating margin decreased 300 bps to 1.0% as the percentage decline in gross profit exceeded the percentage decline in other operating expenses. Other operating expenses in first quarter 2020 included $0.5 million of bad debt expense primarily due to customer bankruptcies.", "Key Werner Logistics Segment Financial Metrics", "Cash Flow and Capital Allocation", "Cash flow from operations in first quarter 2020 was $133.4 million compared to $138.8 million in first quarter 2019, a decrease of 4% due to lower net income offset partially by higher depreciation.", "Net capital expenditures in the first quarter 2020 were $18.8 million compared to $83.4 million in first quarter\u00a0 2019, a decrease of 77%, due primarily to delays in receiving new trucks and trailers from OEMs. We plan to continue to invest in new trucks and trailers and our terminals to improve our driver experience, increase operational efficiency and more effectively manage our maintenance, safety and fuel costs. As a result of our continued investment, the average age of our truck fleet remains low by industry standards and was 2.0 years as of March 31, 2020.", "Gains on sales of equipment in first quarter 2020 were $2.5 million, or $0.03 per share, compared to $5.9 million, or $0.06 per share, in the prior-year quarter. Year over year, we sold 44% fewer trucks and 3% fewer trailers, and we realized significantly lower average gains per truck and trailer. Pricing in the market for our used trucks and trailers continued to weaken in first quarter 2020 due to declining demand.

(NASDAQ: DGICA and DGICB) today reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2020.", "The Company will hold a conference call to discuss these results on Wednesday, April 29, 2020 at 11:00 A.M. Eastern Time. You may listen to the webcast of this conference call by accessing the event link at ", "http://investors.donegalgroup.com", ".", "Significant items include:", "\u00a0", "1", "The \u201cDefinitions of Non-GAAP and Operating Measures\u201d section of this release defines and reconciles data that we prepare on an accounting basis other than U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d).", "2", "Not meaningful.", "Management Commentary", "Kevin G. Burke, President and Chief Executive Officer of Donegal Group Inc., noted, \u201cWhile we are pleased with our results for the first quarter of 2020, our thoughts are centered on the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic is having both globally and locally on our employees, agents, policyholders and stockholders. Donegal Group is closely monitoring the ongoing impact of the pandemic while adhering to the various government requirements and evolving regulations throughout the regions where we operate. We proactively implemented measures in mid-March to promote the safety and health of employees and their families and to ensure a continuation of essential services to agents and policyholders. Our core operations are functioning effectively with the vast majority of our employees performing their duties remotely. We will continue to adapt to meet the changing needs of our customers and to respond to challenges resulting from the ongoing economic impacts in the coming months.\u201d", "Mr. Burke continued, \u201cNet income for the first quarter of 2020 benefitted from solid underwriting performance, with the 97.0% combined ratio for the first quarter of 2020 comparing favorably to the 99.3% combined ratio for the prior-year quarter. We continued to gain traction on underwriting initiatives we have implemented to improve profitability. Our commercial lines segment continued to perform well in spite of ongoing commercial automobile profitability challenges, and we are pleased with the continuing growth we achieved in that segment. The favorable underwriting performance was partially offset by net investment losses, primarily related to the decline in the market value of equity securities we held at March 31, 2020. Setting aside the impact of equity market volatility primarily related to COVID-19, we were pleased with our operating performance for the first quarter of 2020.\u201d", "Jeffrey D. Miller, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Donegal Group Inc., commented on the first quarter results, \u201cNet premiums written declined slightly as we continued to shift our business mix toward a greater proportion of commercial lines where we have historically achieved higher levels of profitability. The loss ratio was 62.6% for the first quarter of 2020, compared to 65.5% for the prior-year quarter, with the decrease largely due to a combination of improving loss cost trends in our core lines of business and relatively mild winter weather conditions throughout our operating regions. The expense ratio for the first quarter of 2020 increased modestly, in part due to our continuing implementation of new technology initiatives that will ultimately enhance our operational capabilities and efficiency. We recorded a $1.6 million income tax benefit during the first quarter of 2020 related to the anticipated carryback of 2018 net operating losses to past tax years, as allowed under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act that was enacted in March 2020.\u201d", "Mr. Burke concluded, \u201cOur net income along with unrealized gains within our available-for-sale fixed-maturity portfolio due to a decline in market interest rates during the first quarter of 2020 contributed to an increase in our book value to $15.92 at March 31, 2020, compared to $15.67 at December 31, 2019.\u201d", "Insurance Operations", "Donegal Group is an insurance holding company whose insurance subsidiaries offer personal and commercial property and casualty lines of insurance in three Mid-Atlantic states (Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania), three New England states (Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont), six Southern states (Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia) and eight Midwestern states (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin)", ".

Weather-related losses of $6.9 million for the first quarter of 2020, or 3.7 percentage points of the loss ratio, decreased from $9.7 million for the first quarter of 2019, or 5.1 percentage points of the loss ratio. Weather-related loss activity for the first quarter of 2020 was lower than our previous five-year average of $10.7 million for first-quarter weather-related losses.", "Large fire losses, which we define as individual fire losses in excess of $50,000, for the first quarter of 2020 were $6.3 million, or 3.4 percentage points of the loss ratio. That amount was slightly lower than the large fire losses of $6.6 million, or 3.5 percentage points of the loss ratio, for the first quarter of 2019.", "Net development of reserves for losses incurred in prior accident years of $4.3 million decreased the loss ratio for the first quarter of 2020 by 2.3 percentage points, compared to $4.0 million that decreased the loss ratio for the first quarter of 2019 by 2.1 percentage points. With the exception of modest unfavorable development in the homeowners and commercial automobile lines of business, our insurance subsidiaries experienced modest favorable development in all lines of business in the first quarter of 2020.", "The expense ratio was 33.4% for the first quarter of 2020, compared to 32.6% for the first quarter of 2019. The increase in the expense ratio reflected an increase in technology systems-related expenses and higher underwriting-based incentive costs for the first quarter of 2020 compared to the prior-year quarter.", "Investment Operations", "Donegal Group\u2019s investment strategy is to generate an appropriate amount of after-tax income on its invested assets while minimizing credit risk through investment in high-quality securities.

Atlantic States Insurance Company issued $50.0 million of debt to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh in exchange for a cash advance in the same amount. The debt carries a fixed interest rate of 0.83% and is due in March 2021.", "Net investment income of $7.4 million for the first quarter of 2020 increased 4.6% compared to $7.0 million in net investment income for the first quarter of 2019. The increase in net investment income reflected primarily an increase in average invested assets relative to the prior-year first quarter.", "Net investment losses of $10.7 million for the first quarter of 2020 were primarily related to unrealized losses in the fair value of equity securities held at March 31, 2020. Net investment gains of $18.1 million for the first quarter of 2019 included $12.7 million from the sale of Donegal Financial Services Corporation with the remainder primarily related to unrealized gains in the fair value of equity securities we held at March 31, 2019.", "Definitions of Non-GAAP and Operating Measures", "We prepare our consolidated financial statements on the basis of GAAP.

We define operating income or loss as net income or loss excluding after-tax net investment gains or losses, after-tax restructuring charges and other significant non-recurring items.

In February 2020, the Company\u2019s operations were impacted by the COVID19 pandemic where state and national \u201cStay-At-Home\u201d orders impacted businesses and their abilities to generate revenue. The Bank has initiated its Business Continuity Plan to protect its employees and communities which, in part, included closing lobbies of branches and directing approximately 40% of its workforce to work remotely. Full banking operations, however, continued with emphasis on bankers conducting customer outreach to understand customer needs and provide support for customer needs. Our mortgage team is busy with robust refinancing activity.", "The Company\u2019s first quarter operating results reflected: (1) improved asset quality that fueled accretion on purchase credit impaired loans and gains on the sale of OREO, (2) a continued robust refinancing market, (3) higher loan loss provisions due to COVID 19 impact on slowing the economy, loan growth and the net impact of specific reserves and net charge-offs, (4) slightly higher non-interest expense due to substantially higher impairment of purchase mortgage servicing, and (5) higher tax expenses.", "\u201cWe are seeing all industries being impacted by the COVID19 pandemic. Restaurants and hotels have seen significant declines in cashflow, while some selected manufactures have seen an uptick in business related to health care products.

Additionally, wholesale distributers are experiencing varying impacts,\u201d said Stephen Bianchi, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cWe are closely monitoring borrowers and businesses we serve and are providing debt service relief for those that have been impacted.

The slight decline was primarily due to a lower level of cash and investments relative to the prior quarter. Cash and cash equivalents declined to $41.3 million at March 31, 2020 from $55.8 million at December 31, 2019 and securities available for sale declined to $163.4 million from $180.1 million over the same time frame.

New commercial real estate, multi-family, agricultural real estate, agricultural non-real estate and construction loans represented the majority of the core loan growth, while commercial non-real estate declined slightly, and Legacy loans continued their planned reductions. The loan portfolio remained stable despite a $12.7 million line of credit taken on December 31, 2019 and repaid on January 2, 2020.", "The originated loan portfolio grew to $790 million or 66.4% of gross loans at March 31, 2020 from $763 million or 64.2% of gross loans at December 31, 2019. Acquired loans declined to $400 million or 33.6% of gross loans from $425 million or 35.8% of gross loans over the same time period. The acquired loans were marked to fair value as of the acquisition date. The Bank\u2019s agricultural real estate and non-real estate loans decreased to $121 million or 10.2% of gross loans at March 31, 2020 from $123 million or 10.4% of gross loans at December 31, 2019.", "The allowance for loan and lease losses increased to $11.8 million at March 31, 2020, representing 1.00% of total loans, compared to $10.3 million and 0.88% of total loans at December 31, 2019. As previously stated, the increase in the allowance was due to loan loss provisions associated with anticipated COVID 19-related economic slowdowns and uncertainty along with loan growth in specific and unallocated reserves. Increases were modestly offset by net charge-offs, which were $485,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, compared to $257,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2019.", "Nonperforming assets decreased to $19.2 million, or 1.28% of total assets at March 31, 2020, compared to $21.6 million or 1.41% at December 31, 2019.

Brokered and institutional certificates decreased to $41 million at March 31, 2020 from $53 million at December 31, 2019.", "Total stockholders\u2019 equity decreased to $148 million at March 31, 2020 from $151 million one quarter earlier, as the Company used capital to pay a dividend to shareholders and repurchase stock. The Company\u2019s shareholder\u2019s equity reflected an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $1.6 million at March 31, 2020 compared to $471,000 a quarter earlier.

However, the flight to safety caused some temporary turmoil in the valuation of the Bank\u2019s investment in Trust Preferred Securities and Student Loan Paper. As such, at March 31, 2020, accumulated other comprehensive loss increased to $1.6 million from $471,000 at December 31, 2019. \u201cThis unrealized loss increase is considered to be a temporary event and is not related to long-term credit changes in the portfolios. The Company has the ability and intent to hold these securities to maturity and expects to collect the principal owed at maturity.\u201d said Jim Broucek, Executive Vice President and CFO", "Effective March 20, 2020, the Company suspended its stock repurchase plan and on February 19, 2020 paid an annual dividend of $0.21 per share. The Company repurchased 156,000 shares during the first quarter for $1.8 million. It is expected the Company will incur some asset growth during the second quarter related to funding PPP loans and the utilization of existing credit lines.

The net interest margin increased to 3.64% for the first quarter of 2020 compared to 3.41% in the preceding quarter and 3.43% for the quarter ended March 31, 2019. For the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s net interest margin benefited from realization of nonaccretable discount due to the prepayment of purchased credit impaired loans of $1.0 million, or 30 basis points compared to $271,000, or eight basis points in the prior quarter. Scheduled accretion for acquired performing loans, was $233,000, $233,000, and $194,000 for the quarters ended March 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively.

The increase in the most recent quarter was largely related to payoff of purchased credit impaired loans with associated purchased credit discounts being accreted into interest income on loans. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased four basis points to 1.46% for the first quarter from 1.50% one quarter earlier and two basis points from one year earlier. The primary decrease in the first quarter funding costs was due to lower deposit costs.", "Loan loss provision increased to $2.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 from $1.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2019. In anticipation of a COVID 19-related economic slowdown, management recorded provision for loan losses of approximately $750,000. Various \u201cStay-at-Home Orders\u201d resulted in temporary business closures, reduced operating capacity and uncertainty regarding potential future revenue and cash flows for certain businesses, including Bank borrowers. Approximately $600,000 of the provision was related to loan portfolio growth in the quarter. The remaining provision was related to the impact of net loan charge-offs of $485,000 and necessary increases in specific and unallocated allowance for loan losses. In the fourth quarter of 2019, approximately $800,000 of provision for loan losses was due to loan growth, and $600,000 was primarily due to increases in specific and unallocated allowances.", "Non-interest income was $3.6 million for the first quarter compared to $3.8 million for the preceding quarter and $2.3 million for the first quarter one year ago. The current quarter reflects slightly lower gains on sale of loans than the preceding quarter, though still elevated relative to the quarter ended March 31, 2019, due to a continued robust mortgage refinancing environment. Loan fees and service charges increased $192,000 from the prior quarter, primarily due to commercial loan customer activity. Other income decreased from the previous quarter which was elevated due to proceeds on a life insurance policy of $196,000 and was partially offset by a $75,000 prepayment penalty on mortgage back securities in the first quarter of 2020.", "Total non-interest expense increased to $10.7 million for the first quarter of 2020, compared to $10.4 million in the prior quarter and $9.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2019. The increase in total non-interest expense for the current quarter relative to the previous quarter is primarily due to (1) $480,000 of impairment on mortgage servicing rights, largely due to higher forecasted future prepayments and (2) higher professional fees related to the year-end audit. Additionally, occupancy expenses increased in the current quarter due to higher winter energy and snow removal expenses. The increase in non-interest expenses also reflected a lower FDIC insurance credit of $56,000 in the first quarter, compared to $145,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in expenses were partially offset by lower compensation and benefit costs, which decreased $285,000 to $5.4 million. The lower expenses were largely due to lower incentive compensation and modestly higher REO gains. The increase in non-interest expense from the quarter ended March 31, 2020 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2019 is due primarily to increased overhead resulting from the F&M acquisition and the items noted above, partially offset by merger-related costs incurred in the quarter ended March 31, 2019.", "Provisions for income taxes were $937,000, or an effective tax rate of 26.5% for the first quarter ended March 31, 2020 compared to $562,000, or an effective tax rate of 15.1% during the preceding quarter. The prior quarter reflected an adjustment to taxes due to clarifications on the tax treatment for certain\u00a0United Bank\u00a0acquired bank-owned life insurance and tax treatment finalization of certain outstanding acquisition items.", "These financial results are preliminary until the Form 10-Q is filed in May 2020.", "About the Company", "Citizens Community Bancorp, Inc.

Eduardo Elsztain and Sa\u00fal Zang, the right to acquire up to a maximum 40% interest in a joint venture formed to hold the Suyai Project, an advanced stage gold project located in Chubut Province in southern Argentina. Messrs. Elsztain and Zang\u2019s portfolio of controlled companies include Argentina\u2019s biggest real estate company, \u00a0NASDAQ-listed international agricultural companies, along with banking and mining investments.

Development of the project would occur under the oversight of a board of directors of the holding company that owns the project with the Argentine group nominating two out of five directors. Yamana would nominate the other directors. The joint venture would be a true joint venture with each party being entitled to its proportion of gold production from the project. \u00a0", "Currently, there is a moratorium on mining in the province of Chubut, which would have to be lifted in order for the project to receive approval to proceed.

The preferred plan option calls for the production of high grade gold concentrate, which would be transported by land and by sea to one or more gold smelters world-wide. As only a concentrate would be produced at Suyai, no cyanide or other deleterious chemicals would be used at site.

It is most commonly caused by a G-to-A point mutation \u2013 referred to as the PiZ allele \u2013 within the SERPINA1 gene, which produces alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) protein. In healthy individuals, the A1AT protein is secreted from the liver and circulates to protect the lungs from damage. In individuals with the mutation, A1AT is misfolded, preventing secretion and resulting in damaging build-up in the liver, as well as loss of its protective function in the lungs. There are currently no curative treatments for patients with Alpha-1.", "\u201cBase editing represents a new frontier in the treatment of serious diseases, including Alpha-1. Directly and permanently correcting the PiZ mutation could potentially deliver a one-time therapy for Alpha-1 patients that addresses both the liver and lung pathologies in this disease,\u201d said John Evans, chief executive officer of Beam. \u201cThese are the first data to be reported from our Alpha-1 program, providing both ", "in vitro", " and ", "in vivo", " proof of concept for base editing to correct this disease.

For this study, Beam engineered novel ABEs and guide RNAs capable of correcting the PiZ mutation, and then applied a proprietary non-viral lipid nanoparticle formulation to deliver the optimized reagents to the livers of PiZ transgenic mice. This direct editing approach resulted in significant levels of precise correction of the PiZ mutation, which were maintained through the duration of the multi-month experiment. Further, the precise correction was associated with decreased A1AT globule burden in the liver and with a beneficial increase in serum A1AT levels and elastase inhibitory capacity.

This occurs, for example, when making the /pae/ sound at the start of the word \u201cpuff\u201d. The research group has shown how plosives produce vortex rings in the air, which are connected regions of rotating fluid that can self-propel themselves and the droplets contained within them over long distances.", "The researchers will first use experimental techniques to measure the velocity of the air that exits the mouth during speech, while also measuring the size and distribution of the droplets that are produced. This information will then be input into numerical simulations that use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to track the motion of representative virus particles as they move throughout the surrounding environment.", "By determining how particles are spread within indoor spaces during speech, the researchers will then be able to predict the infection risk for individuals that are in the vicinity of someone that is speaking.", "\u201cThis is very important work,\u201d says Ferro, \u201cbecause it will allow us to determine what an appropriate safe distance is between individuals to minimize the risk of airborne transmission of the virus, and how this transmission risk is influenced by indoor environments, where accumulation of particles over time can drastically influence the \"safe distance\" and the associated risk of infection.\u201d\u00a0", "\u201cIt feels good to be able to contribute to the current COVID-19 pandemic in a way that can inform public health and keep people safe,\" says Erath. \"As the pandemic quickly progressed, we looked at different ways that we could use our training, education, and backgrounds to help individuals within the local, national, and global community.

MICA and MICB are stress proteins that are selectively expressed at high levels on many solid tumors.\u00a0", "\u201cMICA and MICB are emerging as exciting pan-cancer immunotherapy targets, and we are pleased that our engineered iPSC-derived CAR-MICA/B NK cells have shown potent anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies,\u201d said Scott Wolchko, President and Chief Executive Officer of Fate Therapeutics. \u201cImportantly, since the shedding of MICA/B is a common escape mechanism deployed by many tumors to evade immune cell recognition, we are encouraged that our novel CAR design, which uniquely targets the \u03b13 domain of MICA/B, prevents protein shedding and promotes NK and T cell-mediated tumor immunity.\u201d", "While it is well known that tumor resistance to cytotoxic T cells is mediated by loss of MHC Class I expression, proteolytic shedding of the \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains of MICA/B expressed on tumor cells is a common mechanism of NK cell evasion. A recent publication in ", "Science", " (DOI:10.1126/science.aao0505) by Kai W. Wucherpfennig, M.D., Ph.D., Chair of the Department of Cancer Immunology and Virology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and co-leader of the Cancer Immunology Program at Dana-Farber / Harvard Cancer Center, demonstrated that antibody targeting of the MICA/B \u03b13 domains specifically prevents MICA/B shedding and restores NK cell-mediated immunity. Additionally, in a more recent publication in ", "Cancer Immunology Research", " (DOI: 10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-19-0483), Dr. Wucherpfennig also demonstrated that cancers with ", "B2M", " and ", "JAK1", " inactivating mutations resulting in loss of MHC Class I expression can be effectively targeted with MICA/B \u03b13 domain-specific antibodies to restore NK cell-mediated immunity against solid tumors resistant to cytotoxic T cells.", "Using a clonal master induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line previously engineered with an expression cassette introduced into the CD38 locus that encodes for a high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 Fc receptor and an IL-15 receptor fusion, scientists from Fate Therapeutics introduced a second expression cassette encoding for the novel CAR MICA/B construct. ", "In vitro", " differentiation of the clonal iPSC lines produced homogeneous NK cell populations with uniform expression of CAR MICA/B, hnCD16, and IL15RF, and without any expression of CD38. The iPSC-derived CAR NK cells displayed enhanced cytokine production and cytotoxicity against MICA/B positive tumor cells compared to non-engineered, iPSC-derived NK cells.", "Other Company abstracts selected for presentation at ASGCT include the derivation of clonal master engineered iPSC lines for the Company\u2019s FT576 product candidate, an off-the-shelf, multi-antigen targeted CAR-BCMA NK cell engineered with four anti-tumor modalities for the treatment of multiple myeloma; and a study of various expression systems for the generation, engineering and cryopreservation of clonal master engineered iPSC lines.", "About MICA and MICB Proteins", "The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I related proteins A (MICA) and B (MICB) are induced by cellular stress, damage or transformation, and the expression of MICA and MICB proteins has been reported for many tumor types. Cytotoxic lymphocytes, such as NK cells and CD8+ T cells, can detect and bind the membrane-distal \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains of MICA/B, activating a potent cytotoxic response. However, advanced cancer cells frequently evade immune cell recognition by proteolytic shedding of the \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains of MICA/B. The clinical importance of proteolytic shedding is reflected in the association of high serum concentrations of shed MICA/B with disease progression in many solid tumors. Several recent publications have shown that therapeutic antibodies targeting the membrane-proximal \u03b13 domain strongly inhibited MICA/B shedding, resulting in a substantial increase in the cell surface density of MICA/B and restoration of NK cell-mediated tumor immunity. Therapeutic approaches aimed at targeting the \u03b13 domain of MICA/B therefore represent a potentially promising novel strategy to overcome this prominent evasion mechanism as a means of restoring anti-tumor immunity.", "About Fate Therapeutics\u2019 iPSC Product Platform", "The Company\u2019s proprietary induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) product platform enables mass production of off-the-shelf, engineered, homogeneous cell products that can be administered with multiple doses to deliver more effective pharmacologic activity, including in combination with cycles of other cancer treatments. Human iPSCs possess the unique dual properties of unlimited self-renewal and differentiation potential into all cell types of the body. The Company\u2019s first-of-kind approach involves engineering human iPSCs in a one-time genetic modification event and selecting a single engineered iPSC for maintenance as a clonal master iPSC line. Analogous to master cell lines used to manufacture biopharmaceutical drug products such as monoclonal antibodies, clonal master iPSC lines are a renewable source for manufacturing cell therapy products which are well-defined and uniform in composition, can be mass produced at significant scale in a cost-effective manner, and can be delivered off-the-shelf for patient treatment. As a result, the Company\u2019s platform is uniquely capable of overcoming numerous limitations associated with the production of cell therapies using patient- or donor-sourced cells, which is logistically complex and expensive and is subject to batch-to-batch and cell-to-cell variability that can affect clinical safety and efficacy.

The net interest margin was relatively stable linked-quarter, with the reported decline mainly the result of a $2.5 million, or 4 bps, decrease in purchase accounting accretion related to the MidSouth transaction.

If efforts to contain COVID-19 are unsuccessful and restrictions on movement last into the third quarter or beyond, the recession would be much longer and much more severe. Ineffective fiscal stimulus, or an extended delay in implementing it, are also major downside risks. The deeper the recession is, and the longer it lasts, the more it will damage consumer fundamentals and sentiment. This could both prolong the recession, and/or make any recovery weaker. Similarly, the recession could damage business fundamentals, and an extended global recession due to COVID-19 would weaken the U.S. recovery. As a result, the outbreak and its consequences, including responsive measures to manage it, have had and are likely to continue to have an adverse effect, possibly materially, on our business and financial performance by adversely affecting, possibly materially, the demand and profitability of our products and services, the valuation of assets and our ability to meet the needs of our customers.", "In addition, any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement.

Juniper is unable to provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the overall high variability and low visibility of most of the foregoing items that have been excluded. For example, share-based compensation expense is impacted by the Company\u2019s future hiring needs, the type and volume of equity awards necessary for such future hiring, and the price at which the Company\u2019s stock will trade in those future periods. Amortization of intangible assets is significantly impacted by the timing and size of any future acquisitions. The items that are being excluded are difficult to predict and a reconciliation could result in disclosure that would be imprecise or potentially misleading. Material changes to any one of these items could have a significant effect on our guidance and future GAAP results.

These measures are not presented in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for GAAP. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the table above should not be considered in isolation from measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In particular, certain of the adjustments to our GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future.", "We utilize a number of different financial measures, both GAAP and non-GAAP, in analyzing and assessing the overall performance of our business, in making operating decisions, forecasting and planning for future periods, and determining payments under compensation programs. We consider the use of the non-GAAP measures presented above to be helpful in assessing the performance of the continuing operation of our business. By continuing operation, we mean the ongoing revenue and expenses of the business, excluding certain items that render comparisons with prior periods or analysis of on-going operating trends more difficult, such as expenses not directly related to the actual cash costs of development, sale, delivery or support of our products and services, or expenses that are reflected in periods unrelated to when the actual amounts were incurred or paid. Consistent with this approach, we believe that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the readers of our financial statements provides such readers with useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, allows for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance. In addition, we have historically reported non-GAAP results to the investment community and believe that continuing to provide non-GAAP measures provides investors with a tool for comparing results over time. In assessing the overall health of our business for the periods covered by the table above and, in particular, in evaluating the financial line items presented in the table above, we have excluded items in the following three general categories, each of which are described below: Acquisition and Strategic Investment Related Charges, Other Items, and Share-Based Compensation Related Items. We also provide additional detail below regarding the shares used to calculate our non-GAAP net income per share. Notes identified for line items in the table above correspond to the appropriate note description below. With respect to the items excluded from our forward-looking non-GAAP measures and reconciliation of such measures, please see the \u201cOutlook\u201d section above.", "Note A: Acquisition and Strategic Investment Related Charges", ". We exclude certain expense items resulting from acquisitions including\u00a0amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. The amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisitions results in our recording expenses in our GAAP financial statements that were already expensed by the acquired company before the acquisition and for which we have not expended cash. Moreover, had we internally developed the products acquired, the amortization of intangible assets, and the expenses of uncompleted research and development would have been expensed in prior periods. Accordingly, we analyze the performance of our operations in each period without regard to such expenses. In addition, acquisitions result in non-continuing operating expenses, which would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our business operations. We believe that providing non-GAAP information for acquisition-related expense items in addition to the corresponding GAAP information allows the users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historic and current results of our continuing operations, and also facilitates comparisons to less acquisitive peer companies.", "Note B: Other Items", ". We exclude certain other items that are the result of either unique, infrequent or unplanned events, including the following, when applicable: (i)\u00a0restructuring charges or benefits; (ii) strategic partnership-related charges (iii) legal reserve and settlement charges or benefits; (iv) gain or loss on equity investments; (v)\u00a0significant effects of tax legislation and judicial or administrative interpretation of tax regulations, including the impact of income tax reform; (vi) recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits that are non-recurring in nature; (vii) the income tax effect on our financial statements of excluding items related to our non-GAAP financial measures. It is difficult to estimate the amount or timing of these items in advance. Although these events are reflected in our GAAP financial statements, these transactions may limit the comparability of our on-going operations with prior and future periods. Restructuring benefits or charges result from events that arise from unforeseen circumstances, which often occur outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations. These expenses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred. We also exclude certain expenses incurred for the formation of a strategic partnership, as they are directly related to an event that is distinct and does not reflect current ongoing business operations. In the case of legal reserves and settlements, these gains or losses are recorded in the period in which the matter is concluded or resolved even though the subject matter of the underlying dispute may relate to multiple or different periods. As such, we believe that these expenses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing operations for the period in which they are incurred. Additionally, we exclude previously unrecognized tax benefits that are non-recurring in nature which are recorded in the period in which applicable statutes of limitation lapse or upon the completion of tax review cycles as the tax matter may relate to multiple or different periods. Further, the impact of certain income tax reform, including the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are unique events that occur in periods that are generally unrelated to the level of business activity to which such tax reform or legislation applies. We believe these tax events limit the comparability with prior periods and that these expenses or benefits do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred.\u00a0We also believe providing financial information with and without the income tax effect of excluding items related to our non-GAAP financial measures provide our management and users of the financial statements with better clarity regarding the on-going performance and future liquidity of our business. Because of these factors, we assess our operating performance with these amounts both included and excluded, and by providing this information, we believe the users of our financial statements are better able to understand the financial results of what we consider our continuing operations.", "Note C: Share-Based Compensation Related Items", ". We provide non-GAAP information relative to our expense for share-based compensation and related payroll tax. Due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types, which affect the calculations of share-based compensation, we believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation and related payroll tax allows for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to our peer companies and is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to our results of operations. Further, expense associated with granting share-based awards does not reflect any cash expenditures by the company as no cash is expended.", "Note D: Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share Items", ".

We ended the quarter with strong EBITDAP margins of 13.1%, on sales of $476.1 million.

The Company uses Free Cash Flow, both in presenting its results to stakeholders and the investment community, and in the Company\u2019s internal evaluation and management of the business.

Westfield Bank is doing its part by participating in the PPP loan program. The PPP was designed such that a loan originated under this program will be forgiven if the small business retains its employees and level of payroll through the first two months of the loan. These loans carry a customer rate of 1.00% plus a processing fee that varies depending on the balance of the loan at origination and have a two-year maturity.

FFO represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.", "FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring the company's operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year-over-year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. The company also believes that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare the company's operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the company's properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of the company's properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact the company's results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of the company's performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as the company does, and, accordingly, the company's FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of the company's performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of the company's liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company's cash needs, including the company's ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. FFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.", "Cash Net Operating Income", "The company uses cash net operating income (\"NOI\") internally to evaluate and compare the operating performance of the company's properties.\u00a0The company believes cash NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the company's financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level, and when compared across periods, can be used to determine trends in earnings of the company's properties as this measure is not affected by (1) the non-cash revenue and expense recognition items, (2)\u00a0the cost of funds of the property owner, (3)\u00a0the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP or (4)\u00a0general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to the property owner.

Cash NOI also excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other nonproperty income and losses, acquisition-related expense, gains and losses from property dispositions, extraordinary items, tenant improvements, and leasing commissions.

We believe our philosophy of putting clients first, combined with local decision-making, is the best way to serve our customers during these uncertain times. We have seasoned credit teams at all charters that have experience dealing with significant economic downturns, and all of our employees are dedicated to helping our clients weather this storm.\u201d", "\u201cWe have rolled out our Loan Relief Program that allows impacted clients to defer payments and preserve cash and liquidity,\u201d Helling continued. \u201cAdditionally, our lending teams are actively enrolling many existing and new small-business clients in the SBA Paycheck Protection Program, which was intended to provide much needed capital and liquidity to many of our commercial and non-profit clients. As of April 24th, our banks received approvals from the SBA to fund 1,300 loans totaling $333 million. These approvals were accomplished in a very short amount of time thanks to an extraordinary effort by our staff. We are confident that we will grow our client base as a result of these efforts.\u201d", "\u201cThough the public health crisis did impact our results in the form of lower loan growth and an increased provision for loan losses, our overall credit quality remained strong and our Company was solidly profitable through the first quarter,\u201d Helling added. \u201cI am proud of our first-quarter financial performance and our healthy underlying fundamentals. We remain steadfast in our focus on expanding our presence in the communities we serve across all our charters and providing best in class service through operational excellence, and we believe that we are well positioned to deal with the challenges in front of us.\u201d", "Annualized Loan and Lease Growth of 1.6% for the Quarter", "During the first quarter of 2020, the Company\u2019s total loans and leases increased slightly by $14.5 million to a total of $3.7 billion. Loan and lease growth was adversely impacted by reduced economic activity across all markets as a result of the voluntary or mandatory closures of public venues, businesses, schools and government offices due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the Company received a number of sizable loan paydowns in the beginning of the quarter, further impacting quarter-end loan balances. Core deposits (excluding brokered deposits) increased $132.6 million, or 3.5% on a linked quarter basis. At quarter-end, the percentage of wholesale funds to total assets was 10.1%, which was up from 8.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019 as the Company accessed some short-term wholesale funding out of an abundance of caution. At quarter-end, the percentage of gross loans and leases to total assets was 71%, which was down from 75% in the fourth quarter. \u00a0", "\u201cThe slowdown in economic activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our loan growth for the quarter,\u201d added Mr. Helling. \u201cLoan production slowed significantly in March and that trend has continued into the second quarter.

Adjusted NIM (non-GAAP), excluding acquisition-related net accretion was 3.50%, up 7 basis points from the fourth quarter. The increase in Adjusted NIM (non-GAAP) during the quarter was due to an 11 basis point decline in the total cost of interest-bearing funds (due to both mix and rate), partially offset by a 3 basis point decrease in the yield on earning assets.", "\u201cWe expanded our adjusted net interest margin again during the first quarter as we continued to drive down our deposit costs while successfully increasing core deposits during the quarter. Our average loan yields also declined during the quarter, but at a slower pace than the decrease in our funding costs, expanding our margin,\u201d stated Todd A. Gipple, President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer.", "Noninterest Income of $15.2 million", "Noninterest income for the first quarter of 2020 totaled $15.2 million, compared to $29.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. The fourth quarter of 2019 results included a $12.3 million gain on the sale of RB&T. Excluding this gain, noninterest income totaled $17.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The first quarter decline in noninterest income was mostly due to the sale of RB&T late in the fourth quarter of 2019. Wealth management revenue was $4.0 million for the quarter, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2019. Noninterest income increased 26.7% when compared to the first quarter of 2019.", "\u201cOur noninterest income was down modestly in the first quarter, however, we did experience another strong quarter of swap fee income, which came in at $6.8 million for the quarter, at the high end of our guidance range. Given the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, we are withdrawing our previously announced targeted range for full-year swap fee income and gain on sale of guaranteed portions of loans,\u201d added Mr. Gipple.", "Noninterest Expenses of $31.4 million ", "Noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2020 totaled $31.4 million, compared to $46.3 million and $32.4 million for the fourth and first quarters of 2019, respectively. The linked quarter decrease was due to a number of factors, including a $5.7 million decline in salaries and employee benefits due to the sale of RB&T as well as reduced bonus and incentive compensation, a $2.8 million decline in disposition costs and a $2.5 million lower goodwill impairment charge. In addition, post-acquisition transition and integration costs decreased by $1.7 million due to the completion of the core conversion of Springfield First Community Bank in the fourth quarter of 2019.", "Asset Quality Remains Solid ", "Nonperforming assets (\u201cNPAs\u201d) totaled $16.9 million, an increase of $3.9 million from the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase was primarily due to one lending relationship.

The linked quarter increase in the provision for loan and lease losses was primarily due to increased qualitative factors in response to deteriorating economic conditions. As of March 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s allowance to total loans and leases was 1.14%, which was up from 0.98% at December 31, 2019 and from 1.08% at March 31, 2019.", "In accordance with GAAP for acquisition accounting, loans acquired through past acquisitions were recorded at market value; therefore, there was no allowance associated with the acquired loans at the acquisition date.

By comparison, these respective ratios were 13.33%, 10.18% and 9.25% as of December 31, 2019.

billion, an increase of 2 percent compared to $1.39 billion in the first quarter of 2019 and slightly below the company\u2019s expectations due to the lower level of bookings in the quarter as well as travel restrictions implemented by the company in response to the pandemic.", "On a U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis, first quarter 2020 net earnings were $147 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.47.\u00a0 First quarter 2019 GAAP net earnings were $166 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.51. \u00a0\u00a0", "Adjusted Net Earnings for first quarter 2020 were $223 million, compared to $199 million of Adjusted Net Earnings in the first quarter of 2019. \u00a0Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share were $0.71 in the first quarter of 2020, in line with the Company\u2019s expectations and up 16 percent compared to $0.61 of Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share in the year-ago quarter.\u00a0", "Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share are not recognized terms under GAAP.\u00a0 These non-GAAP financial measures should not be substituted for GAAP net earnings or GAAP diluted earnings per share, respectively, as measures of Cerner\u2019s performance, but instead should be utilized as supplemental measures of financial performance in evaluating our business.\u00a0 Please see the accompanying schedule, titled

of Cerner associates as they quickly adapted to the challenges presented by the pandemic while maintaining an unwavering focus on supporting our clients on the frontlines.\u00a0 While we expect the pandemic to continue affecting our results, we currently believe that the largest impact will occur in second quarter 2020 and expect resiliency in our future financial performance.\u201d", "Future Period Guidance", "Cerner currently expects:", "The future period guidance provided above reflects the Company\u2019s current expectation that the largest impact from the COVID-19 pandemic will occur in the second quarter and that project and sales activity will begin to improve in the second half of the year assuming the impact of the pandemic and related restrictive measures subside during the second quarter.\u00a0 The Company currently believes project and sales activity projected before the pandemic will still occur, but it will occur over a longer period of time than originally anticipated.\u00a0 There is still considerable uncertainty regarding the duration and magnitude of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, so the Company\u2019s forward-looking statements are subject to a higher than normal amount of risk.\u00a0 In particular, the pandemic and related restrictive measures have created significant economic uncertainty, the ultimate impact of which is unknown at this time, which could adversely affect the Company's future operational and financial performance.", "*Future period non-GAAP guidance includes adjustments for items not indicative of our core operations, which may include, without limitation, items included in the accompanying schedule, titled \u201cReconciliation of GAAP Results to Non-GAAP Results.\u201d\u00a0 Such adjustments may be affected by changes in ongoing assumptions and judgments, as well as nonrecurring, unusual or unanticipated charges, expenses or gains or other items that may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations.\u00a0 The exact amounts of these adjustments are not currently determinable but may be significant.\u00a0 It is therefore not practicable to provide the comparable GAAP measures or reconcile this non-GAAP guidance to the most comparable GAAP measures.", "Earnings Conference Call", "Cerner will host an earnings conference call to provide additional detail on the Company\u2019s results and outlook at 3:30 p.m. CT on April 28, 2020. \u00a0On the call, Cerner will discuss its first quarter 2020 results and answer questions from the investment community.
